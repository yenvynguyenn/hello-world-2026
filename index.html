       I usually describe myself as someone deeply interested in how digital tools shape our everyday lives. 
       That’s why I’ve been paying attention to how AI systems handle personal data — especially when they 
       promise convenience and insight. One of the articles that really made me think was The New York Times’ 
       piece about a potential privacy flaw in OpenAI’s ChatGPT, where researchers showed that sensitive 
       information could be extracted from the AI under certain conditions, raising serious questions 
       about what data these large models might retain or reveal. It reminded me how crucial it is to 
       balance innovation with respect for privacy, because tools like ChatGPT are everywhere and we 
       often trust them with our thoughts and information without fully understanding the risks.</p>

        The Lenna image began as a 1972 Playboy photograph of Swedish model Lena Forsén that engineers at 
        the University of Southern California scanned into digital form for early image processing research. 
        Over decades it became a widely used test image in computer vision, appearing in classrooms,
        research papers, and software around the world. In recent years, critics and Forsén herself have
        called for the image to be retired because it continues to be used without her consent and 
        its source can shape perceptions of women in tech.</p>

        Reading “Is My Toddler a Stochastic Parrot?” made me laugh and think. I found it fascinating how a 
         toddler learning language can sometimes mimic patterns just like an AI does, repeating what they 
         hear in unexpected ways. It reminded me how learning — whether in humans or machines — is messy, 
         playful, and full of surprises, and how imitation can be both clever and unpredictable.</p>
